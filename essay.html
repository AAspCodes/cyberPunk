<p>Cyberpunk is a subgenre of Sci-Fi characterized by “high-tech low-life”. It often follows low-social-status-people
    as they rebel against, or simply try to survive under, a high-tech-tyrannical-mega-corporation. The world-building
    that occurs in cyberpunk work often contains futuristic tech like, AI, androids, VR, as well as “old futuristic tech”
    like a rusty old flying car, or an early generation fighting robot. And the societies of these worlds will have a
    legal system that values monetary value over human lives and that is structured to be economically oppressive for
    those on the bottom. Or to put it more simply: CyberPunk works describe worlds of futuristic dystopian
    ultra-capitalism told from the viewpoint of the oppressed working class. In this essay, I will talk about how
    CyberPunk came into existence, how many of its predictions have come true, and how CyberPunk is not going away
    anytime soon, and how there may come a time when the genre is longer considered Science Fiction.

    CyberPunk arose in the 1980s as a response to the sudden increase in the rate of computer innovation, the rise of
    the first mega-conglomerate corporations. And as the mid-century social policies receded into the distance and the
    U.S. slid into the “trickle-down-economics” Regan years, the gap between the rich and poor grew. And so, CyberPunk
    grew as a natural result of the anxieties of the times.

    <span>In the opening track of Billy Idol’s album “Cyberpunk” in the year (1993) the lyrics are:</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    “With no nuclear war, the new battlefields are people's minds and souls
    <br>
    Mega-corporations are the new governments
    <br>
    Computer generated info domains are the new frontiers
    <br>
    Though, there is better living between science and chemistry
    <br>
    We are all becoming slavebots
    <br>
    The computer is the new cool tool
    <br>
    Though we say, "All information shall be free," it is not
    <br>
    Information is power and currency of the virtual world we inhabit
    <br>
    So we mustn't trust authority
    <br>
    Cyberpunks are the true rebels
    <br>
    Cyber-culture is coming in under the radar
    <br>
    An unordinary society, an unholy alliance with the tech world, and a world of organized descent
    <br>
    Welcome to the Cyber Corporation, Cyberpunks"
    <br>
    <br>
    So much of this has come true.

    The top 5 tech companies collectively control 15% of the Market Cap of the S&P 500. And it’s nearly impossible for
    someone to engage in modern living without using one of their products, or having your data gathered by them. As an
    example of this: I’m using a computer made by Apple, that I bought from Amazon, to run a program made by Microsoft,
    to write an essay for a class that I access using a browser and search engine made by Google, all while my phone
    beeps in the background with Facebook notifications.

    This article from Slate.com titled “Something Is Broken in Our Science Fiction'' calls for SF to move beyond
    CyberPunk. This is not going to happen anytime soon. But what will happen is that future works, that would have
    been seen as CyberPunk/SF in the past, will no longer be considered hardcore Science Fiction.  As the technologies
    and objects predicted by CyberPunk become commonplace, CyberPunk becomes less fictional. And instead, is better
    described as a cynical look at our current world with a few fictionalized exaggerations. The “Black Mirror”
    episode “Nosedive” is a great example of this, as it portrays a world where social media ratings have serious
    impacts from accessing housing to getting a job to dating. And as a result, produces a shallow uncompassionate
    dystopian world. This mirrors our world when the endless drive for social media likes and posting the best
    Instagram photos can have real impacts on people’s lives.
</p>
<p>
    The article from Slate.com also calls for an end to the creation of new CyberPunk works. This also won’t happen any
    time soon. As long as the world sees these tech-enabled-inequalities, CyberPunk will continue to strike a chord
    with many who feel left out and oppressed. CyberPunk for the most part doesn’t fictionalize the oppression we
    experience, but it does exaggerate and dramatize it. In this way, it can be a means to call attention to important
    trends and social issues.

<p>
    CyberPunk is a dynamic and interesting subgenre of SF with much to teach us about our modern world. It's
    characterized by a futuristic dystopian setting shown from the working class’s point of view. And as long as
    CyberPunk mirrors many of the issues our society continues to face, it will be with us for many years to come.
